The current metro area population of Toronto in 2020 is around 6 million and trend is getting stronger with many people moving to Toronto because of immigration policies and opportunities.\n\nWith recent pandemic, there is increased awareness and focus on individual health. It is not just about physical health but overall wellbeing including mental health. Regular Yoga practice provides overall wellness and Yoga Studio is the best way to connect yoga teachers and students.\n\nThis increased awareness about Yoga makes a business case for opening a Yoga Studio. However, Yoga Studio has become so popular that such studios are everywhere. Starting a new Yoga Studio is great opportunity, however we need to find a suitable location for long term sustainability of the business. This project explores best locations to open a new Yoga Studio in Toronto, Canada.\n\nBusiness Problem:\nTaking care of physical and mental health is a big part of the healthy lifestyle, however, due to heavy competition, the location of the Yoga Studio can make or break the business. The purpose of the project is to explore the most suitable neighborhood for to open a new Yoga Studio in Toronto, Canada. The project plans to use data science tools, methodology and machine learning algorithms to recommend most appropriate neighborhoods for opening a new Yoga Studio.\n"
